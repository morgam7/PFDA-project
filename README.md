Started the project: Downloaded wind speed data from Met Ã‰ireann form Bellmullet

There were a lot of weather stations but I wanted the ones with windspeed so found a list of the bigger weather stations 
and downloaded 19 of the bigger weather station data. Was a bit clumsy having to download and unzip all the files individually - wonder if there is a better workflow for this.
