## Project Overview

This project analyses historical wind speed [data](https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data) from Met Éireann weather stations in Ireland. The primary goal is to explore trends and potential applications for wind energy projects, such as wind farms. 

This repository contains:
- Jupyter Notebook(s) with data analysis and visualisations.
- Weather data files sourced from Met Éireann.
- Documentation detailing the project's methodology and results.


## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used to support the analysis, visualization, and modeling in this project:

- **pandas**: For cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing the dataset.
- **numpy**: For numerical calculations, particularly with arrays and mathematical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For creating basic plots and visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For more advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
- **jupyter**: To run the analysis in a notebook environment, making it easier to combine code, results, and explanations.
- **glob**: For automating the retrieval of multiple files from directories.
- **sklearn**: Used for predictive modeling and regression analysis.


A `requirements.txt` file is included in the root of the repository. It lists all the Python dependencies needed to run this project.

To install the dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install all the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Files and Structure
- `wind_farm_analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
- `data/`: Directory containing weather data files.
- `README.md`: This file, describing the project structure and usage.
